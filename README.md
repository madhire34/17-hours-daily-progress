# 17 Hours Daily Learning & Work Proof

This repository is my public proof of working/studying **17 hours every day**  
to master **Java, Full Stack Development (MERN), AI/ML, and Cloud Computing (NPTEL)**.

## ðŸ“… How It Works
- Each day has its own folder in `/logs/` with:
  - `log.md` â†’ Daily summary & hours breakdown
  - `/screenshots/` â†’ Proof of time tracking (Clockify, RescueTime, etc.)
  - `/work/` â†’ Code, notes, or projects worked on that day
- Commit every day to keep my GitHub contribution graph active.

## ðŸ”„ Progress Tracking
| Date       | Total Hours | Highlights |
|------------|------------|------------|
| 2025-08-02 | 17          | Java DSA, MERN Backend, AI/ML, Cloud Computing (NPTEL) |
| 2025-08-03 | ...         | ... |

## ðŸ“Œ Goals
- Learn and master **Java, MERN, AI/ML, Cloud Computing**
- Maintain **100% daily commit streak**
- Build public accountability
